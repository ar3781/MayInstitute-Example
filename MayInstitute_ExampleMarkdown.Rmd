```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

knit = creates the R markdown documeent, runs code and text

insert chunk of code with code --> insert chunk or just "```"

name the chunk like so: {r name}

{r, include=FALSE} prevents inclusion of code and results

{r, echo=false} prevents inclusion of code but results are

{r correlation, results="hide"} shows code, no results

```{r import ggplot, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

for plots:
```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, fig.cap="Caption"}
ggplot(cars, aes(x=speed, y=dist)) + geom_point() + ggtitle("My plot with different width and height") + labs(x="speed", y="distance")
```

if you just want to use the command line etc there are ways to run it outside of Rstudio.
